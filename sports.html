					<h2>Soccer</h2>
					<p>My soccer journey began when I was five years old on a small team in the AYSO program. However, when I turned seven, my parents decided to move me to the Glenview Soccer Club (GSC) to enhance my technical and physical abilities. 
					During my early years of travel soccer, I alternated between blocking shots as goalkeeper and scoring goals as a forward. After a few years, I decided to stick to being a part of the offense and made the transition to FC-1, which is the older brother club of GSC. 
					As I continued to progress, high school tryouts approached, and I made the Freshman B team. Even though this seemed like bad news at first since I didnâ€™t make the A team, it was actually a blessing in disguise. 
					I played in all twenty-two of our matches and remarkably, achieved the highest goal count, scoring 18 goals, while also contributing seven assists in the whole program. Following the school season, I joined FC Mirage, a competitive travel club, to maintain my skill.
					With the fall season approaching, my aim is to make the sophomore team and score even more goals and assists than in my freshman year.</p>
