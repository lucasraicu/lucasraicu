						<h2>Sports</h2>
					</header>
					<h2>Soccer</h2>
					<p>My soccer journey began when I was five years old on a small team in the AYSO program. However, when I turned seven, my parents decided to move me to the Glenview Soccer Club (GSC) to enhance my technical and physical abilities. 
					During my early years of travel soccer, I alternated between blocking shots as goalkeeper and scoring goals as a forward. After a few years, I decided to stick to being a part of the offense and made the transition to FC-1, which is the older brother club of GSC. 
					As I continued to progress, high school tryouts approached, and I made the Freshman B team. Even though this seemed like bad news at first since I didn’t make the A team, it was actually a blessing in disguise. 
					I played in all twenty-two of our matches and remarkably achieved the highest goal count, scoring 18 goals, while also contributing seven assists in the whole program. Following the school season, I joined FC Mirage, a competitive travel club, to maintain my skill.
					With the fall season approaching, my aim is to make the sophomore team and score even more goals and assists than in my freshman year.</p>

					<h2>Tennis</h2>
					<p>My tennis journey also began at the age of 5. I first started playing alongside my dad and later transitioned to the Glenview Tennis Club. By participating in private and group lessons, I improved my skills and technique until middle school. 
					When I reached 6th grade, my busy schedule filled with numerous clubs, extracurriculars, and sports prevented me from playing tennis. Fortunately (but not fortunately), when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I finally had more time to get back into the sport. 
					To fine-tune my form, I set up a net in my driveway with my brother, using an inflated rubber basketball as a makeshift tennis ball. When my form improved, I returned to the “real” tennis court. In the summer of 8th grade, I found a coach to help prepare me for high school tennis. 
					Before I knew it, spring came around, and I was back where it all started at the Glenview Tennis Club to tryout for the high school team. I proudly secured a spot on the freshman team! As the number 1 singles player, occasionally on number 1 doubles, I led the team at every meet. 
					One of my most memorable victories was against New Trier with my doubles partner, Daniel, when we made a comeback from 2-6 to 8-6. 
					Even though GBS’s high school tennis season is over, I continue to practice on the court, working with my brother, coach, and dad to further refine my skills and prepare for the upcoming spring season in 2025!</p>

					<h2>Skiing</h2>
					<p>Funny enough, my skiing journey also started at the age of 5. My dad, like in tennis, taught my brother and me how to ski. Growing up in close proximity to Wilmount, Alpine, and Cascade Mountain, we were fortunate to have regular ski outings every winter. 
					During my freshman year, my dad made an exciting decision to purchase skis for all of us. This meant that we no longer had to wait in those long lines for rentals. Just after our finals in January, we made our bags and flew to Keystone, Colorado for a well-deserved break. 
					The climate was perfect during our stay, with a combination of warm, sunny days and snowy conditions. It was a skier's paradise, with powdery snow that made every run perfect. I cherished every moment spent in Colorado. 
					I can’t wait until next winter when the snow returns, and I'm able to get back to slaloming on the slopes with my dad and brother!</p>
