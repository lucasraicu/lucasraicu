						<h2>Music</h2>
					</header>
						<h2>Violin</h2>
					<p> I started playing the violin when I was five years old. Since then, I have been developing my technique with the help of my dad (my first teacher), my brother, private teachers, and orchestra directors along the way. 
					If you’re wondering who my favorite composer is, it would most definitely be Antonio Vivaldi. His most famous piece is the “Four Seasons”. 
					Lindsey Sterling and David Garret are also two violinists that have been a huge inspiration for me. Check out their YouTube channels! <br><br>
					
					Here is a collection of the violin pieces I’ve performed over the years. 
					</p>

					<h2>Piano</h2>
					<p> I started playing the piano when I was seven years old. My favorite piano composer is Rachmaninoff. His “Flight of the Bumblebee” is just amazing! 
					The Piano Guys is a YouTube channel that has motivated for the past several years. Check them out! <br><br>
					
					Here is a collection of the piano pieces I’ve performed over the years.

					<h2>Glenbrook Symphonic Orchestra</h2>
					<p> I am proud to be a member of the 1st violin section in the Glenbrook Symphony Orchestra (GSO). 
					The GSO is an ensemble that combines over 150 student musicians (strings, winds, and percussion) from both Glenbrook North and Glenbrook South.  
					We could not be where we are today without our remarkable directors, Mr. Aaron Kaplan and conductor Rachel Atlas, who taught us to play the music not the notes. <br><br>
					
					During spring break in 2023, we were fortunate enough to travel to New York. 
					It was an unforgettable experience filled with enriching workshops led by Broadway Directors, a performance with a Broadway singer, and a concert in a magnificent cathedral. We even attended two Broadway shows, Camelot and Sweeney Todd.
					</p>

					<h2>Variety Show</h2>
					<p> The Glenbrook South Variety Show (also known as V-Show) is a professional-level production that is probably the largest spectacle of any high-school in the United States. 
					This show features the amazing student talent found at GBS on an annual basis.  <br><br>
					
					My first V-Show was in 2023. My group and I (the Overboard Octet) had to decide on an instrumental piece that would fit the theme, Wonderland. 
					We ended up playing “Pirates of the Caribbean” by David Garret. Check our performance out!!
