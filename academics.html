						<h2>Academics</h2>
						
						</header>
						<p>
						At Glenbrook South High School, I have completed a challenging curriculum focused on mathematics and science. 
						I have studied courses such as Algebra 2, Precalculus, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science, and Medical 
						Technology. I am now aiming to pursue an undergraduate degree in computer science with the ultimate objective of earning a PhD and becoming a 
						professor. <br><br>
						
						I also participate in various STEM and Medicine oriented clubs such as Math Team and Medical Chapter Club. At Attea Middle School, I was one of the founding students of the school's Math Team, leading the school to MathLeague nationals for three years in a row. I am now a starting player on the 
						roster of GBS's Math Team, competing against other neighboring schools in both indvidual and team sections. Driven by the desire of discovering the intersection between STEM and medicine, I am have taken up the role of Technology Director on the Medical Chapter Club board, where I am entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the 
						club's website, bringing in accomplished guest speakers, and expanding the club's reach, through online platforms, to a wider audience of students.
